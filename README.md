# console-based_social_network
Run social_network.py and follow the instructions displayed in console.

3 users have been already created, with their data stored in Users folder.

Users can be created, deleted, create posts, follow or unfollow other users, 
display their timeline or their wall (showing their own timelines and the followed users ones)

For future improvements, a security sistem should be created, saving a password for each user.
Every time a user wants to do any action, authentication must be verified, asking for the password.

In a posterior version, an email should be also linked to each user, to generate a new password in case 
the user does not remeber. An email will be sent to the user with a new random password generated.
